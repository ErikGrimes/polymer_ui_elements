# Basic visual elements for Polymer.dart

A port of polymer.js' [polymer-ui-elements](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-ui-elements) to Polymer.dart.
The intent of the authors is to contribute the work to the Dart project itself (https://www.dartlang.org).

### Non-visual elements for Dart can be found in
* [polymer_elements](https://github.com/ErikGrimes/polymer_elements)

## General notes

* Current development status requires [Dart SDK build 29720](http://gsdview.appspot.com/dart-editor-archive-continuous/29720/) (0.8.9)
